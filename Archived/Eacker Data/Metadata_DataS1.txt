# Metadata Description for DataS1

The zipped folder DataS1 contains 3 analysis files: 1) the JAGS model file ("JAGS_base_IPM.txt"),
and data and model execution files to be used in Program R for the 2) East Fork ("DataS1_EF.txt") and
3) West Fork ("DataS1_EF.txt") populations. All code were implemented using R version x64 3.3.2 and JAGS version JAGS-4.2.0 on a PC running Windows 10 with 16 GB RAM and I7 Intel Core processor. JAGS, which stands for "Just Another Gibbs Sampler" conducts the MCMC in the background and is accessed through R. JAGS-4.2.0 can be downloaded from the Sourceforge website at:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/mcmc-jags/files/. The R package "R2jags" was used to conduct the MCMC sampling from R, which depends on "rjags". After installing R, JAGS, and the package "R2jags", the working directory in R must be set to the location of the JAGS model file. Once the working directory is set, simply run the R code provided. The output can be viewed by calling the named "rjags" object in R (e.g., rr.res_EF). The results will be very similar to those reported in Eacker et al. 2016, but may vary slightly due to the MCMC simulation. The base IPM provided here includes both aerial count and vital rate data, but it can be easily modified to only include count or vital rate data by commenting out these lines in the JAGS model file and modifying the data included in the model (i.e., remove data from the sp.dataEF and sp.dataWF data bundles). We have provided detailed descriptions of the data, parameters, and functions in both the JAGS and data text files, and therefore, we will not go into further detail about them here.
